    challenge: 'FlipMart Logistics was facing severe bottlenecks in their 50,000 sq ft Mumbai fulfillment center. Manual pallet handling across three warehouse levels caused 4-hour average order cycle times, frequent product damage, and a 12% labor turnover rate due to physically demanding work conditions. During peak sale events, the facility was processing only 3,500 orders per day — a fraction of their platform\'s demand.',
    solution: 'We conducted a full warehouse mapping exercise and deployed a fleet of 8 Electric Counterbalance Forklifts (2T) for ground-floor loading operations, paired with 4 Three-Wheel Electric Forklifts for narrow aisle navigation on upper floors. MHE Next\'s team integrated the fleet with the client\'s WMS via telematics, enabling real-time location tracking and task assignment from a central dashboard. Operator training was completed within 3 weeks, and the phased rollout ensured zero disruption to live operations.',
